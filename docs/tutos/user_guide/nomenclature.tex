\nomenclature{PTM}{Program Trace Macrocell: Coresight component of source class which means that PTM generates trace only if the executed instruction changed the PC (e.g. Branch instructions, load pc ..., ..)}
\nomenclature{ETM}{Embedded Trace Macrocell is a Coresight component of source class which generates trace for every executed instruction}
\nomenclature{STM}{System Trace Macrocell is a Coresight component of source class which generates trace and is the most recent component of source class}
\nomenclature{ITM}{Instrumentation Trace Macrocell is a Coresight component of source class which allows to add instructions in C code and to obtain the information that we are unable to obtain from other coresight components}
\nomenclature{Funnel}{Coresight component of link class and allows choosing which trace sources to send to the trace sinks}
\nomenclature{ETB}{Embedded Trace Buffer is a Coresight component of sink class. It is a on chip RAM allowing to store the trace generated from trace source}
\nomenclature{TPIU}{Trace Port Interface Unit is also a Coresight component of sink class and allows to send generated trace data (from trace sources) towards PL or towards outside the chip thansk to MIO}
