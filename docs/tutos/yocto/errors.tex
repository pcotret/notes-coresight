\section{Encrypted file system}
\subsection{Problem}
If you have installed your operating system on an encrypted filesystem and tried to use Yocto on it, you will not be able to compile and those warning message will apear :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Failed to create a file with a long name in TMPDIR. Please use a filesystem that does not unreasonably limit filename length.
	\item Failed to create a file with a long name in SSTATE\_DIR. Please use a filesystem that does not unreasonably limit filename length.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution}
Reasonnable solutions are (do not forget to update paths into your bblayers.conf) :
\begin{itemize}
\item Moving all Yocto directories and files into a non-encrypted partition.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mv Yocto /PathToNonEncryptedPartition/Yocto
\end{lstlisting}
\item Create a non-encrypted partition and mounted it on /media/yocto, then create directories sstate-cache and tmp into it. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd /media/yocto
mkdir tmp sstate-cache 
\end{lstlisting}
Open your local.conf file into your project folder within the encrypted-partition.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
emacs /home/user/Yocto/poky/build/conf/local.conf
\end{lstlisting}
and modify those lines: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
TMPDIR = "/media/yocto/tmp"
SSTATE_DIR ?= "/media/yocto/sstate-cache"
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}
